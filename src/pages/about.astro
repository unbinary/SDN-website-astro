      <h2>Our Story</h2>
      <p>We recognized something important: while traditional local media was disappearing, community gathering places were thriving. The arenas, golf courses, and recreation centers where Canadians spend their time became the new town squares—vibrant, consistent, and impossible to ignore.</p>
      <p>Sports Digital Network was founded on a simple insight: if you want to reach local communities, you need to be where those communities actually gather. Not on billboards they drive past. Not in publications they don't read. But in the places they choose to spend their time, week after week.</p>
      <div class="highlight">We're not just selling advertising space. We're connecting brands to the moments and places that matter most to their customers.</div>
      <p>Today, we operate a network of premium digital displays across Canada's busiest community venues. Our screens reach over 3.6 million people every week—families watching their kids play hockey, golfers closing business deals, communities coming together in spaces they're proud of.</p>

            <h3>Quality Over Quantity</h3>
            <p>We're selective about our venue partnerships. We'd rather have 100 exceptional locations than 1000 mediocre ones. Better venues mean better results for advertisers.</p>
