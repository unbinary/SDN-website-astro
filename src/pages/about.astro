      <h2>Our story</h2>
      <p>Sports Digital Network was founded with a simple observation: as local newspapers closed and traditional advertising fragmented, community gathering places didn't disappear - they got busier.</p>
      <p>Every week, millions of Canadians spend meaningful time at local arenas watching their kids play hockey, at golf courses building business relationships, and at recreation centers connecting with neighbors. These venues became the new town squares - and the most authentic way to reach local communities.</p>
      <div class="highlight">We built SDN to bridge the gap between brands seeking engaged local audiences and venues looking for new revenue streams.</div>
      <p>Today, our network spans 100+ premium venues across Canada, delivering 35 million weekly impressions to audiences that are genuinely present and engaged - not scrolling past or skipping ahead.</p>

            <h3>Community first</h3>
            <p>We believe advertising should enhance community spaces, not detract from them. Every campaign we run reflects the values of the venues and families we serve.</p>

            <h3>Quality over quantity</h3>
            <p>We'd rather deliver fewer, more meaningful impressions than chase vanity metrics. Our network is curated, not commoditized.</p>

            <h3>Partnership mindset</h3>
            <p>Our venue partners aren't just locations - they're collaborators. Their success is our success, and we invest accordingly.</p>
