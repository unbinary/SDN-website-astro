  <p>The short answer: arena advertising in Canada ranges from a few hundred dollars per month for a single digital screen placement at a community arena to tens of thousands per month for a national multi-venue campaign. The cost depends on format, market size, number of venues, and campaign duration.</p>

  <h2>Pricing by format</h2>

  <h3>Digital screen advertising</h3>
  <p>Digital screens are the most flexible arena advertising format. You get full-screen placement on a 65-inch 4K display in the arena lobby, spectator area, or near the scheduling board.</p>
  <p><strong>Pricing model:</strong> Monthly flat rate (for direct buys) or CPM (for programmatic). Rates vary by market.</p>
  <p><strong>What you get:</strong> Full-screen ad, design services typically included, creative updates at any time, impression reporting, flexible commitment lengths.</p>

  <h3>Rink boards</h3>
  <p>Traditional rink boards (dasher boards) are static panels mounted to the hockey boards facing spectators. They're visible throughout every on-ice session.</p>
  <p><strong>Pricing model:</strong> Seasonal or annual. A single standard rink board (3'x8') in a community arena typically costs a few hundred to a couple thousand dollars per season.</p>

  <h3>Other formats</h3>
  <p>Zamboni wraps, glass decals, wall banners, and lobby signs are generally quoted individually. Prices depend on the specific arena, placement, and size.</p>

  <h2>What affects the price</h2>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Market size</strong> — A placement in the GTA will cost more than in a smaller market</li>
    <li><strong>Venue traffic</strong> — Arenas with 15,000–25,000 weekly visitors command higher rates</li>
    <li><strong>Number of venues</strong> — Multi-venue campaigns receive volume discounts</li>
    <li><strong>Campaign duration</strong> — Longer campaigns get better rates</li>
    <li><strong>Format</strong> — Digital screens are generally priced at a premium to static boards</li>
    <li><strong>Exclusivity</strong> — Category exclusivity may carry a premium</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Is arena advertising worth the cost?</h2>

  <p>A typical busy community arena sees 10,000–20,000 visitors per week. Over a 12-week campaign, that's 120,000–240,000 total visitor exposures — and these are repeat visitors who see your ad multiple times.</p>

  <p>Arena advertising's advantage is <strong>cost-per-engaged-minute</strong>. Your audience sees your ad for 60–90 minutes per visit, 2–4 times per week, for the duration of your campaign. No other medium delivers that combination of frequency and dwell time at a comparable price point.</p>
