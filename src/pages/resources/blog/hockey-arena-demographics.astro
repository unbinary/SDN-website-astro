  <Fragment slot="title">Arena demographics: who attends community hockey?</Fragment>
  <Fragment slot="excerpt">Detailed demographic data on the audience inside Canadian community arenas — and why they're such a valuable advertising audience.</Fragment>

  <p>Understanding who visits community hockey arenas is essential for any advertiser considering arena advertising. The data consistently shows that arena visitors represent one of the most valuable audience segments available in Canadian marketing.</p>

  <h2>Household income</h2>

  <p>Community arena visitors have household incomes approximately <strong>35% above the Canadian national average</strong>.</p>

  <p>This is driven by the cost of hockey participation. According to recent surveys, the average cost to register a child in minor hockey ranges from $3,000 to $7,000+ per season — and that's before equipment, travel, and extra training. Competitive hockey families often spend $15,000–$25,000+ per child per year.</p>

  <p>This self-selects for households with significant discretionary income.</p>

  <h2>Age distribution</h2>

  <p>The typical arena visitor is a parent aged <strong>30–50</strong>, though the full range spans from young children to grandparents.</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Children (under 18):</strong> 30–35% of visitors (players and siblings)</li>
    <li><strong>Young adults (18–29):</strong> 10–15% (players, referees, some spectators)</li>
    <li><strong>Adults (30–50):</strong> 40–45% (parents, coaches)</li>
    <li><strong>Older adults (50+):</strong> 10–15% (grandparents, senior programs)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Family composition</h2>

  <p>Community arenas are overwhelmingly <strong>family environments</strong>. The majority of visitors are:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Parents with children</li>
    <li>Married or common-law households</li>
    <li>Multi-generational families (grandparents attending games)</li>
  </ul>

  <p>This makes arenas particularly effective for reaching household decision-makers during family time.</p>

  <h2>Geographic concentration</h2>

  <p>Arena visitors are <strong>highly local</strong>. The typical community arena draws visitors from a 15–25 km radius. In suburban areas, this radius may be even smaller.</p>

  <p>This geographic concentration makes arena advertising exceptionally efficient for local businesses. You're not paying to reach people outside your service area.</p>

  <h2>Repeat visitation</h2>

  <p>Hockey families are <strong>repeat visitors</strong>. During the October–April season:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The average hockey family visits their home arena 2–4 times per week</li>
    <li>Many families visit additional arenas for away games and tournaments</li>
    <li>Summer hockey camps and programs extend the season year-round</li>
  </ul>

  <p>This creates natural advertising frequency that compounds over the course of a campaign.</p>

  <h2>Spending patterns</h2>

  <p>High-income families with children are among the highest-spending consumer segments. Arena visitors over-index for spending on:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Automotive (new and used vehicles, service)</li>
    <li>Dining and restaurants</li>
    <li>Travel and vacation</li>
    <li>Home improvement and renovation</li>
    <li>Financial services</li>
    <li>Retail (sporting goods, apparel, electronics)</li>
    <li>Healthcare (dental, vision, physio)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>The bottom line</h2>

  <p>Arena demographics read like a marketer's wish list: high income, family households, local concentration, repeat visitation, and high spending across multiple categories. For advertisers who want to reach this audience, community arenas are one of the most efficient media channels available.</p>
