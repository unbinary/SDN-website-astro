  <p>DOOH stands for Digital Out-of-Home — advertising displayed on digital screens in public spaces. If you've seen an ad on a screen at a mall, transit station, gas pump, or arena, you've seen DOOH.</p>

  <p>DOOH is one of the fastest-growing advertising channels in Canada, combining the broad reach and brand-building power of traditional OOH with the targeting, flexibility, and measurement capabilities of digital advertising.</p>

  <h2>How DOOH differs from traditional OOH</h2>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Dynamic content</strong> — Digital screens can display multiple ads in rotation, change creative by time of day or day of week, and be updated remotely in real-time</li>
    <li><strong>Flexible buying</strong> — You can buy by the week or month rather than committing to annual contracts</li>
    <li><strong>Targeting</strong> — Some networks offer targeting by location, venue type, or audience characteristics</li>
    <li><strong>Measurement</strong> — Digital screens can report actual ad plays, and many networks provide impression estimates based on venue traffic data</li>
    <li><strong>Programmatic access</strong> — DOOH inventory can be purchased through demand-side platforms (DSPs) using the same workflows as digital advertising</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How programmatic DOOH works</h2>

  <p>Programmatic DOOH allows agencies and advertisers to buy digital out-of-home inventory through automated platforms. Instead of calling each screen network individually, you can access hundreds of thousands of screens through a single DSP.</p>

  <p>The buy typically works on a CPM (cost per thousand impressions) basis. You set your budget, targeting parameters, and creative, and the system automatically places your ads across screens that match your criteria.</p>

  <h2>Place-based DOOH networks</h2>

  <p>Place-based networks operate screens in specific venue types rather than general public spaces. Examples include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Sports venues</strong> — arenas, recreation centres, golf courses</li>
    <li><strong>Health and fitness</strong> — gyms, physiotherapy clinics, waiting rooms</li>
    <li><strong>Retail</strong> — malls, grocery stores, convenience stores</li>
    <li><strong>Transit</strong> — subway stations, bus shelters, airports</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Place-based networks deliver more targeted audiences than general OOH. A screen in a hockey arena reaches a very different audience than a screen on a downtown street corner.</p>

  <h2>Why DOOH is growing</h2>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Digital ad fatigue</strong> — Online advertising is increasingly cluttered, blocked, and ignored</li>
    <li><strong>Brand safety</strong> — DOOH is immune to the brand safety issues that plague programmatic digital</li>
    <li><strong>Attention</strong> — Physical screens in real-world environments command more attention than banner ads</li>
    <li><strong>Incremental reach</strong> — DOOH reaches audiences during moments when they're not looking at their phones</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Getting started with DOOH</h2>

  <p>You can buy DOOH through your existing agency or DSP (for programmatic), or directly with networks like SDN (for direct deals with more customization).</p>
