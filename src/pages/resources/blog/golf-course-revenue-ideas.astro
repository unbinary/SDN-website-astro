  <p>Golf courses are always looking for revenue opportunities beyond green fees and memberships. One increasingly popular option is digital advertising in the clubhouse — screens that display advertising alongside weather, sports scores, and course information.</p>

  <p>Here's how it works and what kind of revenue you can expect.</p>

  <h2>How clubhouse advertising works</h2>

  <p>A digital advertising network like SDN installs commercial-grade digital displays in your clubhouse — typically in the lounge, bar area, pro shop, or restaurant. The screens show a mix of content:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Advertising from national brands and local businesses</li>
    <li>Weather and sports scores</li>
    <li>Course announcements and tee times</li>
    <li>Community content</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The network handles everything: equipment installation, content management, advertising sales, and ongoing maintenance. The golf course receives a share of advertising revenue with no operational involvement.</p>

  <h2>Revenue potential</h2>

  <p>Revenue depends on your location, traffic, and membership profile. Premium courses in affluent areas generate higher advertising rates because advertisers value the audience. Club courses with strong traffic in their lounge and restaurant generate more impressions.</p>

  <p>Typical revenue for a busy clubhouse can provide meaningful supplemental income — essentially free money for space you're already using.</p>

  <h2>Why advertisers want golf course clubhouses</h2>

  <p>Golf course visitors are an exceptionally valuable advertising audience:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>High income:</strong> Golfers have above-average household incomes, especially at private clubs</li>
    <li><strong>Homeowners:</strong> Golf club members have high homeownership rates with above-average property values</li>
    <li><strong>Long dwell time:</strong> Members spend 30–90 minutes in the clubhouse post-round</li>
    <li><strong>Repeat visitors:</strong> Regular golfers visit weekly or more frequently</li>
    <li><strong>Receptive mood:</strong> Golfers are relaxed and social in the clubhouse environment</li>
  </ul>

  <p>This audience is attractive to financial services, automotive, real estate, travel, premium retail, and local businesses targeting affluent consumers.</p>

  <h2>What's required from the golf course</h2>

  <p>Not much. The network provides and installs the equipment. The network manages the content. The network sells the advertising. The golf course provides:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Permission to install screens in agreed locations</li>
    <li>Power and internet connectivity</li>
    <li>Basic access for occasional maintenance</li>
  </ul>
