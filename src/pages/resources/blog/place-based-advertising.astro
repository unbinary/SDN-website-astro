  <Fragment slot="excerpt">Why screens in venues are the fastest-growing segment of Canadian digital out-of-home advertising.</Fragment>

  <p>Place-based advertising — digital screens in specific venue types rather than general public spaces — is the fastest-growing segment of the Canadian out-of-home market. While traditional billboards and transit ads continue to have their place, advertisers are increasingly shifting budget toward screens inside gyms, arenas, golf courses, healthcare facilities, and retail locations.</p>

  <h2>What is place-based advertising?</h2>

  <p>Place-based advertising puts screens where people spend time, not just where they pass through. Instead of a billboard that gets 6 seconds of attention (if any), place-based screens reach audiences who are:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Stationary</strong> — sitting, waiting, watching</li>
    <li><strong>Dwelling</strong> — spending 30+ minutes in the environment</li>
    <li><strong>Self-selected</strong> — there by choice, indicating interests and demographics</li>
    <li><strong>Receptive</strong> — in environments where advertising is expected and accepted</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Why place-based is growing</h2>

  <h3>Better attention metrics</h3>
  <p>Place-based advertising delivers attention metrics that dwarf traditional OOH and digital advertising. A screen in a hockey arena reaches viewers for 60–90 minutes. A screen in a gym reaches them for their entire workout. A screen in a doctor's waiting room reaches them for their full wait time.</p>

  <h3>Predictable demographics</h3>
  <p>The venue determines the audience. A screen in a golf clubhouse reaches affluent golfers. A screen in a hockey arena reaches families with children in sports. This self-selection is more reliable than digital targeting.</p>

  <h3>Context and trust</h3>
  <p>Place-based screens exist in environments that viewers have chosen to be in. This positive context transfers to the advertising. Compare this to interruptive digital ads that viewers actively try to avoid.</p>

  <h3>Brand safety</h3>
  <p>Place-based advertising is immune to the brand safety issues that plague programmatic digital. Your ad isn't appearing next to objectionable content or on fake websites.</p>

  <h2>Types of place-based networks</h2>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Sports and recreation:</strong> Arenas, golf courses, gyms, recreation centres</li>
    <li><strong>Healthcare:</strong> Doctor's offices, pharmacies, dental clinics, hospitals</li>
    <li><strong>Retail:</strong> Grocery stores, convenience stores, malls</li>
    <li><strong>Transit:</strong> Airports, subway stations, ride-share screens</li>
    <li><strong>Hospitality:</strong> Hotels, restaurants, bars</li>
    <li><strong>Office:</strong> Elevator screens, lobby displays, coworking spaces</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>The future of place-based</h2>

  <p>As digital advertising becomes more cluttered and less trusted, and as measurement technology improves for physical-world advertising, place-based networks will continue to grow. The fundamental advantage — reaching people where they spend meaningful time rather than brief moments — is structural, not cyclical.</p>

  <p>For Canadian advertisers, place-based represents an opportunity to reach engaged audiences in ways that digital advertising increasingly cannot.</p>
