  <Fragment slot="title">Local advertising alternatives</Fragment>
  <Fragment slot="excerpt">An honest comparison of every local advertising option available in Canada — what works, what doesn't, and what it actually costs.</Fragment>

  <p>If you're a local business looking to advertise, you have more options than ever — but also more confusion. Digital platforms promise precise targeting but deliver rising costs and uncertain results. Traditional media is declining but still has its place. New options like arena advertising and place-based DOOH are growing.</p>

  <p>Here's an honest look at your options.</p>

  <h2>Facebook and Instagram advertising</h2>
  <p><strong>Pros:</strong> Precise targeting, flexible budgets, easy to start, good for brand awareness and promotions.</p>
  <p><strong>Cons:</strong> Rising costs (average CPMs have doubled in 3 years), declining organic reach, ad fatigue, privacy changes have degraded targeting accuracy, significant portion of impressions don't reach humans.</p>
  <p><strong>Best for:</strong> E-commerce, event promotion, businesses with strong visual content, retargeting existing website visitors.</p>

  <h2>Google Ads</h2>
  <p><strong>Pros:</strong> Reaches people actively searching for your service, measurable ROI, high intent traffic.</p>
  <p><strong>Cons:</strong> Expensive for competitive keywords ($5–$20+ per click for service businesses), requires ongoing management, doesn't build brand awareness.</p>
  <p><strong>Best for:</strong> Service businesses with high customer lifetime value, businesses where people actively search for solutions.</p>

  <h2>Local newspapers and magazines</h2>
  <p><strong>Pros:</strong> Trusted local brand, reaches older demographics, editorial environment.</p>
  <p><strong>Cons:</strong> Declining readership, single-exposure ads, no targeting, difficult to measure results.</p>
  <p><strong>Best for:</strong> Reaching older demographics, businesses that benefit from editorial credibility.</p>

  <h2>Local radio</h2>
  <p><strong>Pros:</strong> Broad local reach, frequency through repetition, can be affordable in smaller markets.</p>
  <p><strong>Cons:</strong> Diminishing listenership, no visual element, difficult to target, streaming services fragmenting audience.</p>
  <p><strong>Best for:</strong> Businesses needing broad awareness, time-sensitive promotions.</p>

  <h2>Direct mail</h2>
  <p><strong>Pros:</strong> Physical presence, can be highly targeted geographically, stands out in a digital world.</p>
  <p><strong>Cons:</strong> High production and delivery costs ($0.30–$0.50+ per piece), low response rates (1–2%), perceived as junk mail.</p>
  <p><strong>Best for:</strong> High-value services, real estate, new business openings.</p>

  <h2>Arena and sports venue advertising</h2>
  <p><strong>Pros:</strong> Extended dwell time (60–90 minutes), repeat exposure (same families 2–4x/week), affluent family demographics, local geographic concentration, positive community context.</p>
  <p><strong>Cons:</strong> Primarily reaches families with children in sports, limited to hockey season for arenas (October–April), requires creative that works at a distance.</p>
  <p><strong>Best for:</strong> Local businesses targeting families, service businesses (dental, auto, HVAC), retailers, anyone wanting to build community presence.</p>

  <h2>Community sponsorships</h2>
  <p><strong>Pros:</strong> Builds goodwill, supports the community, can include multiple touchpoints.</p>
  <p><strong>Cons:</strong> Difficult to measure ROI, can be time-intensive to manage, may not reach beyond the sponsored group.</p>
  <p><strong>Best for:</strong> Businesses with strong community ties, long-term brand building.</p>

  <h2>The bottom line</h2>

  <p>There's no single best local advertising option. The right mix depends on your business, budget, and goals. What's clear is that digital advertising alone is not the answer — costs are rising, attention is falling, and trust is eroding.</p>

  <p>A balanced approach that includes physical-world touchpoints like arena advertising often outperforms a digital-only strategy.</p>
