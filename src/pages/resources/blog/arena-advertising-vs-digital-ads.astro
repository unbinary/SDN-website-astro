  <p>If you're a local business in Canada, you've probably tried advertising on Facebook and Google. You've also probably noticed that costs keep rising, attention keeps falling, and it's increasingly hard to know if your ads are actually working.</p>

  <p>Arena advertising offers an alternative that more local businesses should consider. Here's why.</p>

  <h2>1. You get real attention, not a fraction of a second</h2>

  <p>The average Facebook ad is seen for <strong>1.7 seconds</strong>. The average Google Display ad gets <strong>0.4 seconds</strong> — and that's if it's not blocked entirely.</p>

  <p>In a hockey arena, your audience is sitting in the stands or waiting in the lobby for <strong>60–90 minutes</strong>. They see your ad on a full-screen digital display, repeatedly, during that entire time. There's no skip button, no ad blocker, and no competing tabs.</p>

  <h2>2. Your audience actually exists</h2>

  <p>Digital advertising is plagued by fraud, bots, and inflated metrics. Studies suggest that 20–40% of digital ad impressions never reach a human being.</p>

  <p>Arena advertising reaches real people in a real building. Every impression is a human being who walked through the door. There's no question about whether your ad was actually seen.</p>

  <h2>3. You're in a trusted environment, not a hostile one</h2>

  <p>Consumers increasingly view online advertising with suspicion. They install ad blockers. They scroll past without engaging. They associate digital ads with tracking and privacy invasion.</p>

  <p>Arena advertising appears in a positive context — their kid's hockey game, a family outing, a community event. The positive association transfers to your brand.</p>

  <h2>4. You reach your actual local market</h2>

  <p>Digital advertising promises hyper-targeting, but in practice, a significant portion of your budget reaches people outside your service area, people who already know you, or people who will never become customers.</p>

  <p>Arena advertising is inherently local. Everyone in that building lives or works within 15–25 km. They're your actual potential customers.</p>

  <h2>5. You get frequency that builds recognition</h2>

  <p>The same families visit the same arena 2–4 times per week for months. Your ad is there every time they walk in. By the end of a 12-week campaign, your target audience has seen your ad 24–48 times.</p>

  <p>That kind of frequency is expensive and intrusive with digital advertising. In an arena, it happens naturally.</p>

  <h2>The bottom line</h2>

  <p>Digital advertising has its place, but for local businesses that need to build recognition and trust within a specific geographic community, arena advertising offers something digital cannot: extended attention, verified human impressions, positive context, and natural frequency — all at a competitive price.</p>
