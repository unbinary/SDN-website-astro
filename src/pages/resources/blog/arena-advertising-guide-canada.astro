  <Fragment slot="excerpt">Everything you need to know about arena advertising — how it works, what it costs, who it reaches, how effective it is, and how to get started.</Fragment>

  <p>Arena advertising is one of the most effective and underused forms of out-of-home advertising in Canada. Every week, millions of Canadians visit community hockey arenas, recreation centres, and sports complexes — and they don't just pass through. They sit in the stands for 60–90 minutes watching a game, wait in lobbies, and walk corridors multiple times per visit.</p>

  <p>For advertisers, this creates an opportunity that billboards, transit ads, and digital media simply cannot replicate: extended, repeated exposure to a captive audience in a trusted community environment.</p>

  <h2>What is arena advertising?</h2>

  <p>Arena advertising refers to any paid advertising placement inside a community hockey arena, ice rink, or recreation facility. The term covers a range of formats, from traditional rink boards and banners to modern digital screens and experiential activations.</p>

  <p>In Canada, community arenas are among the most visited public buildings in the country. There are approximately 2,500 indoor arenas nationwide, and they serve as gathering places for hockey, figure skating, public skating, broomball, ringette, tournaments, trade shows, and community events.</p>

  <h2>Types of arena advertising</h2>

  <h3>Digital screens</h3>
  <p>The fastest-growing format in arena advertising. Commercial-grade digital displays (typically 55–65 inches) are installed in lobbies, spectator areas, hallways, and near scheduling boards. They display rotating content — advertising, sports scores, weather, and facility information — in high definition.</p>

  <p>Digital screens offer several advantages: ads can be updated remotely, creative can include motion and video, multiple advertisers can share a single screen, and content can be scheduled by time of day or day of the week.</p>

  <h3>Rink boards (dasher boards)</h3>
  <p>The classic arena advertising format. Rink boards are physical panels mounted to the hockey boards surrounding the ice surface, facing the spectator seating. They're visible throughout every game, practice, and skating session.</p>

  <h3>Wall boards and banners</h3>
  <p>Large-format banners or rigid signs mounted on arena walls, typically in lobby areas, spectator viewing sections, and hallways. Sizes range from standard (4x8 feet) to king-size (4x16 feet) and custom mega banners.</p>

  <h3>Zamboni / ice resurfacer wraps</h3>
  <p>Vinyl wraps applied to the ice resurfacing machine. The resurfacer drives across the ice during every intermission and between sessions, giving the advertiser visibility to every person in the arena.</p>

  <h2>Who does arena advertising reach?</h2>

  <p>Arena visitors represent a specific and valuable demographic that's difficult to reach through other media.</p>

  <h3>Family composition</h3>
  <p>Community arenas are predominantly family environments. The typical arena visitor is a parent (aged 30–50) accompanying one or more children to hockey, figure skating, or other activities. This means arena advertising reaches household decision-makers during a family activity.</p>

  <h3>Household income</h3>
  <p>Arena visitors have household incomes approximately <strong>35% above the Canadian national average</strong>. Hockey registration alone costs $3,000–$7,000+ per year per child. These are households with significant discretionary spending.</p>

  <h3>Geographic concentration</h3>
  <p>Arena visitors live locally. The typical community arena draws visitors from a 15–25 km radius, making arena advertising an exceptionally efficient way to reach a concentrated geographic area.</p>

  <h3>Repeat visitation</h3>
  <p>The same families visit the same arena <strong>2–4 times per week</strong> during hockey season (October through April). This repeat visitation creates natural frequency that compounds advertising impressions.</p>

  <h2>How effective is arena advertising?</h2>

  <p>Arena advertising effectiveness is driven by three factors:</p>

  <h3>Dwell time</h3>
  <p>A hockey game lasts 60–90 minutes. A tournament day can mean 4–8 hours in the building. Compare this to a billboard (6 seconds of exposure) or a digital banner ad (0.4 seconds, if it's seen at all).</p>

  <h3>Frequency</h3>
  <p>The same visitors return to the same arena multiple times per week. A 12-week campaign can deliver 24–48 exposures per visitor.</p>

  <h3>Context and trust</h3>
  <p>Arena advertising appears in a community setting that visitors associate with positive experiences. This positive context transfers to the brands that advertise there.</p>

  <h2>How much does arena advertising cost?</h2>

  <p>Arena advertising costs vary based on format, market, and campaign scope:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Digital screen advertising</strong> — priced monthly (for direct buys) or on a CPM basis (for programmatic)</li>
    <li><strong>Rink boards</strong> — usually sold on a seasonal or annual basis</li>
    <li><strong>Other formats</strong> — Zamboni wraps, glass decals, wall boards quoted individually</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How to get started</h2>

  <ol>
    <li><strong>Define your objectives</strong> — Brand awareness? Specific offer? Target audience?</li>
    <li><strong>Choose your market and venues</strong> — Local arenas or national network</li>
    <li><strong>Select your format</strong> — Digital screens, rink boards, or combination</li>
    <li><strong>Create your ad</strong> — Static image (1920x1080) or short video (up to 15 seconds)</li>
    <li><strong>Launch and measure</strong> — Track results through impression reports and customer attribution</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>The bottom line</h2>

  <p>Community arenas offer something that almost no other advertising environment can match — an affluent, captive audience that returns to the same building multiple times per week and stays for over an hour each visit.</p>

  <p>Whether you're a local business trying to become the household name in your community or a national brand looking for incremental reach beyond digital and traditional media, arena advertising deserves a serious look.</p>
