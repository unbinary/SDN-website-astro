  <p>If you manage a hockey arena or recreation centre, you know the challenge: ice time revenue covers operating costs, but margins are thin. Finding additional revenue streams can mean the difference between breaking even and having budget for improvements, programming, and staff.</p>

  <p>Here are proven revenue opportunities that Canadian arenas are using to supplement ice rental income.</p>

  <h2>Digital advertising</h2>

  <p>Installing digital screens in lobbies, spectator areas, and hallways creates a passive income stream from advertising. Networks like SDN install screens at no cost, sell the advertising, and share revenue with the venue.</p>

  <p><strong>Revenue potential:</strong> Depends on venue traffic and location, but busy multi-pad arenas can generate meaningful monthly revenue with zero operational effort.</p>

  <p><strong>Pros:</strong> No upfront cost, no staff time required, predictable monthly income.</p>

  <h2>Naming rights and sponsorship</h2>

  <p>Selling naming rights to your facility (e.g., "The [Company] Arena") or to specific areas (rink names, lobby, viewing areas) can generate significant revenue from local businesses seeking community presence.</p>

  <p><strong>Revenue potential:</strong> Varies widely by market. Community arena naming rights typically sell for five to six figures annually in major markets.</p>

  <p><strong>Pros:</strong> Long-term contracts, high-value relationships.</p>

  <h2>Rink boards and static advertising</h2>

  <p>Traditional rink board (dasher board) advertising remains popular with local businesses. You can sell boards directly or through a broker.</p>

  <p><strong>Revenue potential:</strong> A full set of boards across multiple pads can generate substantial annual income.</p>

  <p><strong>Pros:</strong> Established format, local advertiser demand is strong.</p>

  <h2>Premium rentals and events</h2>

  <p>Beyond regular ice time, consider premium pricing for tournaments, private events, corporate functions, and birthday parties. Non-ice events like trade shows, concerts, and community gatherings can use your facility during shoulder seasons.</p>

  <h2>Concessions and vending</h2>

  <p>Upgrading your concession offerings or partnering with food vendors can increase per-visitor revenue. Modern options include automated ordering, better menus, and healthy alternatives.</p>

  <h2>Pro shop and retail</h2>

  <p>A well-stocked pro shop serving your user base — skate sharpening, tape, equipment, apparel — captures spending that would otherwise go to external retailers.</p>

  <h2>Programming revenue</h2>

  <p>Offering programs beyond ice rentals — hockey schools, public skating, skating lessons, birthday party packages, summer camps — generates additional revenue while increasing facility utilization.</p>

  <h2>The bottom line</h2>

  <p>Modern arenas generate revenue from multiple streams. Digital advertising is particularly attractive because it requires no upfront investment and no staff time — a partner handles everything while you receive monthly payments.</p>
