            <h3>How much does it cost to advertise at a single arena?</h3>
            <p>Local single-venue campaigns are our most affordable option, designed for small business budgets. Rates depend on the specific venue and your campaign length. Longer commitments get better rates.</p>

          <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>What creative specs do you accept?</h3>
            <p>Static images (1920x1080 px, JPG/PNG) and video (MP4, up to 15 seconds, 1080p). Our design team can produce creative at no extra charge.</p>

            <h3>Do I need to provide my own ad design?</h3>

        <h2>Campaigns and targeting</h2>
        <div class="faq-grid">
          <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>How long is a typical campaign?</h3>
            <p>Campaigns run in 4-week increments with a minimum 4-week commitment. Longer flights receive preferred rates.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>How long should I run my campaign?</h3>
            <p>We recommend a minimum of 12 weeks. Arena advertising builds recognition through repetition — the same families see your ad week after week. The longer you run, the stronger the recall.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>Can I target specific venues?</h3>
            <p>Yes. Select individual venues, groups of venues in a market, or activate across the entire national network.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>Can I advertise at multiple arenas?</h3>
            <p>Absolutely. Many local businesses advertise at 2-5 nearby venues to cover their entire service area. Multi-venue packages are available at reduced rates.</p>

        <div class="faq-grid">
          <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>How is arena advertising measured?</h3>
            <p>We report impressions based on verified venue foot traffic data. All screens provide proof-of-play confirmation.</p>

          <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>Can I buy programmatically?</h3>
            <p>Yes. We're integrated with Broadsign and available through major DSPs. Contact us for Deal IDs.</p>

          <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>Is this better than sponsoring a local team?</h3>
            <p>Team sponsorship gets your name on a jersey seen by one team's parents. Arena advertising puts your message in front of every person who walks into the building — across every sport, every age group, and every event. The reach is dramatically larger.</p>
